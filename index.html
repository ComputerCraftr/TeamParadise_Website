          Team Paradise was founded in 2002 as an FRC team. FRC is the FIRST Robotics Competition, empowered by FIRST, an international youth organization that focuses on inspiring young people to be science and technology leaders and innovators. We are based in Phoenix, Arizona at Paradise Valley High School. Our team has been operating for 20 seasons and counting, winning the 2008 and 2009 regionals and winning the Chairman's award in 2017. Winning those allowed our team to go to Houston and compete in the championships, and allowed our team to meet a variety of new people. In our most recent season, 2022, Team Paradise attended both the North Arizona Regional and the Arizona Valley Regional. Our team is very proud of how we finished at the North Arizona Regional as we are still rebuilding from Covid, which took away some of the seniors who couldn't pass on their knowledge to the freshmen and sophomores. Our team has around 30 members, and quite a few adults who help mentor, assist, and run the club.
